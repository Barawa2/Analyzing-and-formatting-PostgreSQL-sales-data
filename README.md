## Project Overview
The project is aimed at challenging and enhancing SQL skills in data cleaning. The aim is to identify top categories based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values.Date fields have been written to orders table as TEXT and numeric fields like sales and profits have been written to the orsers table as Double Precision. PostgreSQL was the tool used in this project and provided an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in a practical setting and gain valuable experience in data cleaning and analysis.
